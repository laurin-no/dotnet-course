## Purpose of this task

The purposes of this task are:

- to learn basics of ASP.NET Razor Pages style web application
- to learn routing to pages
- to learn to handle GET and POST requests in Razor Pages app

## Material for the task

> **Following material will help with the task.**

It is recommended that you will check the material before begin coding.

1. [Introduction to Razor Pages in ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/razor-pages/?view=aspnetcore-6.0)
2. [Tutorial: Create a Razor Pages web app with ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/razor-pages/?view=aspnetcore-6.0)

## The Task

Create a Phone database web application with ASP.NET Razor Pages. The app has basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) operations on data. The app uses SQLite database as a persistent storage for phone data. The model classes, DbContext and SQLite configuration is given. The task is to create the user interface and code to handle user's actions.

### Evaluation points

1. Index page (/) that renders text: `Welcome to the Phone database in Razor Pages` in H1 tag. And top 3 latest added phones with all info (all fields' data) in a HTML table element. Each property is in its own table cell. The table must contain a header row with the property names on columns. The `Id` property is in the first column.
2. A list page (/phones) that lists all the phones from the database in alphabethical order by Make and then by Model fields. Use `ul` element with css class `phones` to list the phones. Each `li` element in the `ul` element contains the phone's make and model as the element's text content and links (a tag) to edit and delete pages for the current phone. The list page has also a link to add phone page.
3. Add page (/phones/add) that contains fields for all Phone class' properties except the fields that are populated by the app (the fields are marked with code comments on the class declaration). Use `Phone` class as the bind property type and use `Phone` as the property's name. Model the fields so that POSTing the form will add a new phone information to the database. The page must not contain any other fields for data input. When the POST is successfull the app redirects to /phones page to list all the phones including the newly added phone.
4. Edit page (/phones/edit/[id]) that allows editing of the phone's data. Value for the [id] part of the url selects the phone by it's Id property to be edited. Edit page renders input fields for all of the `Phone` class' properties and marks input fields for properties Id, Created and Modified to readonly so user gets the indication that these fields should not be modified by the user. The page must not contain any other fields for data input. Use `Phone` class as the bind property type and use `Phone` as the property's name. POSTing the form makes the changes to the selected phone object and persists them to the database. When the POST is successfull the app redirects to /phones page to list all the phones including the changed phone.
5. Delete page (/phones/delete/[id]) that shows all of the selected phone's details and a button (submit type) where user can click to confirm delete. POSTing the confirmation form deletes the selected phone from the database. When the POST is successfull the app redirects to /phones page to list all the remaining phones.

> Note! Read the task description and the evaluation points to get the task's specification (what is required to make the app complete).

## Task evaluation

Evaluation points for the task are described above. An evaluation point either works or it does not work there is no "it kind of works" step inbetween. Be sure to test your work. All working evaluation points are added to the task total and will count towards the course total. The task is worth five (5) points. Each evaluation point is checked individually and each will provide one (1) point so there is five checkpoints. Checkpoints are designed so that they may require additional code, that is not checked or tested, to function correctly.

## DevOps

There is a DevOps pipeline added to this task. The pipeline will build the solution and run automated tests on it. The pipeline triggers when a commit is pushed to GitHub on main branch. So remember to `git commit` `git push` when you are ready with the task. The automation uses GitHub Actions and some task runners. The automation is in folder named .github.
